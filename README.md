## Syllabus

Each day (session) is designed to take around 5 hours, not counting breaks. There is an optional homework at the end of each day. The sessions are spread apart by a week or two.


### Day 1

Learning outcomes:

- Navigate the folder structure
- Familiarize with the Ember CLI
- Understand syntax for components
- Design components that are accessible, extensible, and maintainable
- A brief look at helper, modifier, and utility


### Day 2

Learning outcomes:

- Load data and respond to the user
- Understand syntax for routes
- Analyze tradeoff between a nested and sibling route
- Inject a service to run A/B testing
- A brief look at `ember-concurrency`


### Day 3

Learning outcomes:

- Understand syntax for tests
- Recognize what to test in a unit, rendering, or application test
- Develop [best practices for writing tests](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/10/11/write-tests-like-a-mathematician-part-3/)
- Create test helpers and custom assertions
- A brief look at `ember-a11y-testing`, `ember-cli-mirage`, and `sinon.js`


### Day 4 (in planning)

Learning outcomes:

- Create an addon
- Create an engine
- Server-side render with FastBoot


## Target Audience

I designed the app with 2 goals in mind:

- Help onboard developers to Ember.js
- Help existing users adopt newer patterns

Due to lack of time, I didn't write a step-by-step guide that would let you pursue self-learning. I hope to do so in the future.

For now, if you have a mentor role, please go over the [commit history](https://github.com/ijlee2/ember-workshop/commits/main) to decide what to cover in your onboarding.
